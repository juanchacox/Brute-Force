<h1 align="center">Brute-force Password Cracker in Python</h1>

This is a **brute-force password cracker** developed in Python using the `hashlib` library. The script compares the hashed version of a given password with hashes of words in a dictionary file, attempting to find a match.

## Features

- Brute-force attack using a wordlist.
- MD5 hashing algorithm to match the password.
- Easy to extend with different hashing algorithms.
- Handles errors such as missing dictionary files.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following components installed:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- A dictionary file (`diccionario.txt`) containing possible passwords, with one word per line.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juanchacox/Brute-Force-Password-Cracker.git
   cd repository-name

This README provides a clear overview of how to use the brute-force script, along with legal considerations and contribution guidelines.
